## 📖 Problem Statement  
Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.

## 🖥️ Solution Code  
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestSubarray(self, nums):
        left = 0
        zero_count = 0
        max_len = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zero_count += 1

            while zero_count > 1:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zero_count -= 1
                left += 1

            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

        return max_len - 1
